# Cinnamon Buns

## Ingredients

### Buns

- 100 g unsalted butter
- 500 g milk
- 150 g granulated sugar
- 1 envelope dry yeast
- 4 g salt
- 2 g cardamom
- 800 g flour

### Filling

- 100 g unsalted butter
- 80 g sugar
- 14 g cinnamon

### Garnish

- 1 egg
- Pearl sugar

## Instructions

- Warm sous vide water to 35C/95F.
- Mix yeast, sugar, salt, and cardamom.
- Cut up butter in strips or smaller pieces to melt easier.
- Put yeast/sugar mix, butter, and milk  in a ziplock bag (with a weight if needed)
- Sous vide for 30 min. (This will create a friendly environment for the yeast)
- Make dough from the flour and the sugar/milk liquid.
- Divide dough in two-four parts and roll out both halves thin. If you have a large enough surface, you don't need to divide — I just find it easier to work with in smaller doughs.
- Spread soft butter carefully, and sprinkle with sugar/cinnamon mix.
- Roll them up from the longer side, and cut in 1.5cm/0.6" slices.
- Let the cut pieces rest on their sides for 30 min.
- Brush with whisked egg.
- Sprinkle with pearl sugar.
- Bake in oven for 8 min at 250C/480F.
